# SecondBite
Think beyond the bin

According to Greenly’s report of Global Food Wastage in 2024, “Over a third of all food produced (~2.5 billion tons) is lost or wasted each year. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates this wasted food is worth $230 billion.” 

To tackle this problem we brainstormed a way to reduce wastage at both household and commercial levels while fostering a sustainable ecosystem. With SecondBite, we propose a solution where individuals can sell surplus food at discounted prices to nearby consumers within a specific radius. We will also be providing restaurants to sell their bulk food waste at low prices to local farmers. This waste will be serving as a valuable compost for agricultural purposes. 

Our vision for SecondBite is to facilitate this peer-to-peer exchange, which will not only minimize waste but also make affordable food options accessible to those in need. Our platform harnesses the power of community collaboration to create a more efficient and sustainable food ecosystem.
